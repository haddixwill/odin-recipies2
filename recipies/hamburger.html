                <li>Seasoning</li>
                <li>Buns</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Lettuce</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the grill: Start by preheating your grill to medium-high heat. This allows the grill grates to get hot and helps create those desirable grill marks and caramelization on the burgers.</li>
                <li>Shape the patties: Take your ground meat of choice (usually beef) and gently form it into patties. Aim for patties that are about ¾ to 1 inch thick. Make sure the patties are slightly larger in diameter than your burger buns, as they tend to shrink during cooking.</li>
                <li>Season the patties: Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and pepper or any other desired seasonings. You can also mix in some minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, or other flavor-enhancing ingredients into the meat before shaping the patties.</li>
                <li>Oil the grill grates: To prevent the patties from sticking, lightly oil the grill grates. Use tongs to hold a folded piece of paper towel soaked in vegetable oil and rub it over the grates.</li>
                <li>Grill the burgers: Place the patties on the preheated grill, and close the lid. Cook the burgers for about 4-5 minutes on the first side, then flip them using a spatula. Continue grilling for an additional 4-5 minutes for medium doneness, adjusting the time based on your desired level of doneness (less for medium-rare, more for well-done).</li>
                <li>Add cheese (optional): If you want to add cheese to your burgers, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty during the last minute or so of cooking. Close the grill lid to allow the cheese to melt.</li>
                <li>Check for doneness: To ensure the burgers are cooked to your desired level, use an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the patty. For medium-rare, aim for an internal temperature of 130-135°F (55-57°C). For medium, aim for 140-145°F (60-63°C). For well-done, aim for 160°F (71°C) or above.</li>
                <li>Rest the burgers: Once the burgers are cooked to your liking, transfer them to a plate or a clean surface. Let them rest for a couple of minutes to allow the juices to redistribute within the patties.</li>
                <li>Assemble the burgers: While the burgers are resting, prepare your burger buns and desired toppings. Toast the buns if desired, and assemble the burgers by placing the patties on the bottom bun and adding your choice of toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, condiments, and sauces.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy: Place the top bun on the assembled burger, and your delicious homemade hamburgers are ready to be enjoyed! Serve them with a side of fries, coleslaw, or any other favorite accompaniments.</li>
