        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cooking a steak to perfection involves a delicate balance of technique and timing. Start by selecting a high-quality steak, such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon, ensuring it is well-marbled for optimal flavor. Prior to cooking, allow the steak to come to room temperature, as this ensures even cooking. Season the steak generously with salt and pepper, or your preferred seasoning blend, allowing it to infuse the meat for about 30 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>High quality steak</li>
                <li>Seasoning</li>
                <li>Butter</li>    
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Select a high-quality steak: Choose a cut of steak that suits your preferences, such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon. Look for a steak with good marbling, which indicates tenderness and flavor.</li>
                <li>Let the steak come to room temperature: Take the steak out of the refrigerator and allow it to rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This ensures more even cooking.</li>
                <li>Season the steak: Generously season the steak with salt and pepper or your preferred seasoning blend. You can also add herbs or spices for additional flavor. Let the steak sit with the seasoning for a few minutes to enhance the flavors.</li>
                <li>Preheat the cooking surface: If using a stovetop method, preheat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat until it becomes smoking hot. If using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Cook the steak: Place the steak onto the hot cooking surface. Allow it to sear without moving it for a few minutes until a golden-brown crust forms. Flip the steak using tongs and cook the other side.</li>
                <li>Check the doneness: Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. For reference, medium-rare is around 135°F (57°C), medium is around 145°F (63°C), and well-done is around 160°F (71°C). Alternatively, you can use the touch method, where a rare steak feels soft and spongy, medium-rare is slightly springy, and well-done feels firm.</li>
                <li>Rest the steak: Once the steak reaches your desired level of doneness, remove it from the heat and let it rest on a cutting board for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicier steak.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve: Slice the steak against the grain to maximize tenderness. Serve it hot with your favorite side dishes and sauces, and enjoy!</li>
