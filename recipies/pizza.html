        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cooking pizza is a delightful culinary process that combines the art of dough-making, the creativity of toppings, and the satisfaction of a perfectly baked pie. From the moment you begin preparing the ingredients to the final moments of savoring a slice, the journey of cooking pizza is an experience filled with anticipation and mouthwatering aromas.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dough</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Toppings</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven: Start by preheating your oven to a high temperature, typically around 450°F (230°C) or as per the recipe instructions. Preheating ensures that the oven is hot enough to properly cook the pizza.</li>
                <li>Prepare the dough: If you're making your own pizza dough, combine flour, water, yeast, salt, and any other desired ingredients in a mixing bowl. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Alternatively, if you're using store-bought dough, follow the package instructions for preparation.</li>
                <li>Let the dough rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free area. The rising time can vary, but it usually takes around 1-2 hours for the dough to double in size.</li>
                <li>Prepare the sauce: While the dough is rising, you can make the pizza sauce. Combine canned crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce with herbs like oregano, basil, and garlic. Simmer the sauce on the stove until it thickens slightly, and the flavors meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough: Once the dough has risen, gently punch it down to release any air bubbles. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape—round, rectangular, or any other creative shape you prefer. Ensure that the dough is evenly rolled to a consistent thickness.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough: Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough onto a baking sheet or pizza stone dusted with cornmeal or flour. This will prevent the dough from sticking.</li>
                <li>Add the sauce and toppings: Spread the prepared pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Then, sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese or any other cheese of your choice. Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, sliced vegetables, cooked meats, or fresh herbs.</li>
                <li>Bake the pizza: Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake it until the crust turns golden brown, the cheese melts, and the toppings are cooked. The baking time can vary depending on the thickness of the dough and the toppings used but generally takes around 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove and cool: Once the pizza is cooked to your liking, carefully remove it from the oven using oven mitts or a pizza peel. Transfer it to a cutting board and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy: Slice the pizza into wedges or squares and serve it while it's still hot. Enjoy the delicious flavors and textures of your homemade pizza!</li>
